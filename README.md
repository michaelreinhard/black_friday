I analysed sales at three Indian department stores. The sales information included product category, store, and information about the customers. The variable of interest was 'Purchases'. 

I found no significant differences among any of the demographic groups in their total purchases. I did find differences between the purchases of men and women in a few of the product categories. I was able to explain 65% of the variance in purchases using a random forest model.
